## This is a Machine Learning project that:
  1. Uses the InceptionV3 model to predicts the contents of an image.
      The InceptionV3 Model was retrained using a furniture dataset.
  2. Allows a user to upload a video
  3. Splits the video into frames 
  4. Detects the objects in each frame using the VGG16 model
  5. Allows the user to search if a particular object is in the video.
  6. Returns the frames with searched object or an error message if it does not exist.
